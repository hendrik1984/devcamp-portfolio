        <p>with over a decade of development experience in a number of industries i realized that the typical product creation process between clients and developers was flawed. All too often developers rarely communicate to clients throughout the development stage, resulting in a final product that fails to reach the goal sought by the customer and end user.</p>
        <p>For this reason i decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly focused communication and transparent design patterns. When i take on a project not only do i work to craft the application according to the client's specifications, i give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly with the client's goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on budget.</p>
